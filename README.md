# TrÃ¤welldroid

This is a community app for the open source project
[TrÃ¤welling](https://github.com/Traewelling/traewelling).

## How it is developed

The app is using the official AndroidX framework by Google. Crashes of the app are detected and
transmitted by [Sentry](https://sentry.io). For the production version of the app a self-hosted
Sentry instance is used.

At the moment the app is available on Google Play. You can download the app there:
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hbch.traewelling)

## Setup

First of all you should copy the `key.properties.example` file in the root directory and copy the
contents into a `key.properties` file. With those properties the main keys and URLs of the
application
can be set.

| Property name        | Usage                                                                                   | Mandatory |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `SENTRY_DSN`         | The DSN used for error logging with Sentry.                                             | No        |
| `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`    | The OAuth client id from [Traewelling.de](https://traewelling.de/settings/applications) | No        |
| `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` | An optionally custom redirect uri                                                       | No        |
| `REPO_URL`           | The URL to the repository                                                               | No        |
| `PRIVACY_URL`        | URL to the privacy statement and imprint.                                               | Yes       |

After that, open Android Studio and the project should setup itself automatically.
