[![Download on Google Play](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Traewelldroid/traewelldroid/dev/assets/badges/google-play-badge.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hbch.traewelling)


## How it is developed

The app is using the official Jetpack Compose framework by Google. Crashes of the app are detected
and transmitted by [Sentry](https://sentry.io). For the production version of the app deployed to
Google Play, a self-hosted Sentry instance is used. Feature Flags are possible and implemented via
a self-hosted Unleash instance.
